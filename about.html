        <p>Well it is a long story, it all started when we got obsessed with crystals and then kept going through our
            lifes then in third grade finnaly we made a idea of making books since we were obsessed in crystals already
            we made some books made in google docs and took like 1-3 months</p>
    <p>The GCRNN was originally just be a mineral series but we changed it to have  also some books about native americans </p>
